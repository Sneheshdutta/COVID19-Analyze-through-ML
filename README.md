##Corona Virus Explained in Simple Terms:
Let's say Raghav got infected yesterday, but he won't know it untill next 14 days
Raghav thinks he is healthy but he is infecting 10 persons per day
Now these 10 persons think they are completely healthy, they travel, go out and infect 100 others
These 100 persons think they are healthy but they have already infected 1000 persons
No one knows who is healthy or who can infect you
All you can do is be responsible, stay in quarentine
